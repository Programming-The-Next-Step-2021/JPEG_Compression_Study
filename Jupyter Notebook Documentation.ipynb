    "THE EXPERIMENT\n",
    "In this experiment, we will examine how accurate human visual perception can be, by testing participants reactions to different images. While people can definitely judge, whether something they see in a photograph is subjectively beautiful or not, we want to test if people can acutally perceive the objective quality of the image itself - represented by the resolution.\n",
    "We will show participants two pictures, which apparently show the exact same motive. But while one of them will contain its original quality, the other one will have a lower resolution and therefore inferior quality.\n",
    "The task for the participant is, to recognize, which of the pictures is the one with the lower resolution. This is much harder than you think. Trust me, I tried it myself multiple times.\n",
    "The level of compression varies between the different trials - some of the pictures will be displayed in only 10% quality of the original, while other pictures will be displayed in up to 90% of the original resolution.\n",
    "Participants can make their choices by pressing one of two buttons and we will measure their reaction time and if they gave the correct response in every trial. The expectation is, that the lower the resolution of the picture, the lower the error rate will be and the faster the reaction. \n",
    "With this experimental framework, it´s easy to examine the construct of visual perception and the task itself won´t take longer than 5 to 10 minutes. If you want to expand the duration of the experiment, the code makes it very easy for every researcher to ft it to his personal needs. "
