# JPEG_Compression_Study
Important_Changes
This project is about creating an experiment which deals with the visual perception of images. The goal of the experiment is to test how much you can compress certain JPEG files until participants notice the change in quality. The code will contain both the experimental design and a programme to compress JPEG files.

In the compression_code.py file, you can find the code that deals with compressing JPEG files.
In the experimental_design.py file, you can find the code for all important trials of the experiment, as well as for the user interface.
A file about the data_analysis will follow. Also there are some random JPEGs in here, that sooner or later will end up in a separate folder or document.
